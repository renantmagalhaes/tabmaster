# TabMaster — Chrome Tab and Bookmark Manager

**TabMaster** is a minimalist Chrome extension that brings Vivaldi-style tab and bookmark search to any Chromium browser.

Search, filter, and quickly switch between your open tabs, bookmarks, history, and recently closed tabs — all from a unified popup.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 Fuzzy search across:
  - Open tabs
  - Bookmarks
  - History
  - Recently closed tabs
- � **Omnibox Address Bar**: Type a URL (e.g., `google.com`) and hit Enter to open it directly if no item is selected.
- 🔎 **Default Search Engine**: Type any text that isn't a URL, and it will search using your default browser engine.
- �🎯 Full keyboard navigation (arrow keys + enter)
- 🖱️ Unified scrollbar for smooth navigation
- 📌 Sticky headers to visually separate categories
- 🧩 Lightweight — built with vanilla JS + Fuse.js

> Inspired by **Vivaldi's Quick Command Panel**, but portable and customizable!
